Redux Thunk is a middleware for Redux that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. 
This function can perform asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API, and dispatch actions based on the results.
By handling asynchronous logic in thunks, you can keep your Redux actions pure and synchronous. 
It simplifies complex state management tasks in React-Redux applications.
